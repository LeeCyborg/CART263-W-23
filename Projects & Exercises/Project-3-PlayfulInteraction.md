# Project 3 - Playful Interaction 
## 40%, Groups of 2 (required)
## Prototype Playtesting session: March 28/30th 
### Final Due April 11/13th 

### Overview
Create a playful interaction that expands beyond a single computer screen and involves more than 1 person in some capacity. This can mean:  
- 2 screens connected remotely (MQTT, HTTP Request, any other protocol you like). 
- an interaction between an active data set and a player.    
- a game or interaction between 2 players in the same space. 
- a game or interaction between a player and a physical space facilitated by a computer. 
- anything else in the spirit of the assignment you can imagine.   

A game or playful interaction must have rules in some variety. This can mean the player can intentionally control and play with your creation to achieve a goal of some sort. Your creation may (but is not required to) have a points system, and should progress in some capacity as the user interacts. 

You can use: 
- Makey Makey. 
- MQTT. 
- Web sockets. 
- bluetooth. 
- Arduino. 
- Camera / video / Kinect.  
- Anything else you can imagine
