# Project 2 - Data Visualization
## 20%, individual work 

### Overview
Create a piece of code that visualizes any data set in a meaningful way. This can be a piece of live data or information taken from an API, or it can be a data set you have downloaded. Be creative, try and get away from basic charts or maps and represent your data in an interesting, informative, and unique way. Pick a data set that is meaningful to you, and share that information with your audience

I suggest using a CSV file to get data like we looked at in class, although if you are so inclined you can choose another format or source.  

Be sure to use Object Oriented concepts to make your code, it will allow you to make more complex work 
### Grading And Submissions
Submit your work on Github AND on Moodle. Be sure to include a README that has a link to your data set, an image of your final result, your sketches and ideas, and any libraries or other information needed to run your code. 
50% Concept, creativity and execution  
25% Code quality, readme file and comments 
25% Complexity and exploration

### Resources & Examples
Some of these files are really big, you might need to make them smaller or reduce the amount of data. Start small.
