# Project 1 - Particles With Personalities
## 20%, individual work, due week 5 

### Overview
Each student will create a particle system using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Everyone will be assigned a "personality" for their system, which should be embodied using movement, colors, and behaviors of your particle system. Consider: 
* Color and shape
* Speed, movements, or easing 
* Number of particles and how they interact with each other 
* Interactions or behaviours of the system with the user or environment
* Other creative elements like sounds, changes over time, or other ways of expression. 

Be creative, look up particle systems and see whats possible. 

### Grading And Submissions
* Code is commented clearly and concisely, it is uploaded to Moodle and Github 
* Your repository has screen shots and a readme.md file clearly explaining your project
* Code uses OOP concepts correctly and effectively, and runs properly without crashing, lagging, or other mishaps
* Program is creative and clearly embodies the personalities assigned
* Overall complexity and implementation
