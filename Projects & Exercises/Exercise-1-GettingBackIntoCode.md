# Exercise 1 - Getting Back Into Code 
##10%. individual work. Due week 2. 

### Overview 
This project is an opportunity to quickly get back into practice in coding after the holidays. You can pick between one of the following classic programming problems to solve using P5js, or come up with another idea. 

For this project, you should not use pre-existing code. Feel free to use the reference, or look up concepts, but you must code this all yourself. **Its okay if your code doesn't work fully, you're encouraged to explore and get as far as you can and get as far as you're able to.**

#### Option 1: Tic Tac Toe (https://www.exploratorium.edu/brain_explorer/tictactoe.html)
Create a TicTacToe game that is able to keep score and determine if there is a winner. It should be fully playable and have:
* 9 squares, 3x3 grid 
* X and O should appear in the grid as each player takes a turn clicking
* When X or O has 3 in row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game displays a "win" screen and then clears the board
* After each game, X or O's score increases on the bottom of the screen. 
* The players should be able to play an unlimited number of games. 

#### Option 2: Pong (https://www.ponggame.org/)
Create a Pong game where 2 players bounce a ball back and forth horizontally to score points. Your game should have: 
* 2 paddles that move vertically using Up & Down arrows, and W & S. 
* A ball should bounce between the two paddles 
* A point is scored when the ball passes the opponents's paddle without being hit. 
* The ball should hit the walls of the screen and bounce on an angle. 
* The first player to 10 points wins


### Requirements, Grading & Submission

All code must be submitted via Github repository as well as on Moodle. You will be graded on:
* 75% Code is well commented and uploaded to Github and Moodle. Code comments should explain clearly what each part of the code does, functions and variables should be clearly named. You should have a clear readme.md file that explains how far you got and how it works. 
* 25% functionality of code. **The goal of the project is less about creating fully functional code, and more about exercising your brain after the break**!
