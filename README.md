## Territorial acknowledgment
We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community. 

## Description 
Learning to program is at the heart of understanding computation. In this course we cover an introduction to the key elements of programming, all while emphasizing experimental and playful approaches to software aesthetics. Students will learn object oriented 

## Learning Objectives 
After completing this course, students should be able to:   
Read, understand and write JavaScript   
Comfortably use the arts-oriented library p5 to make digital art   
Use programming to explore and express their ideas   
## Key activities 
### Lectures 
Each week will include a number of lecture videos and notes covering a specific topic in JavaScript programming and libraries for students to follow in their own time before that week’s class time. 
Each class will begin with a discussion about previous work and answer questions, share examples, etc. We will cover a new topic, and write code together. 
After the lecture, we will have open time to do project or class work. It is highly recommended that students spend time in class working on their projects and use the time of the instructor and TA. 

### Critique 
All projects will have group critique. Students are expected to show up to class ready to share their work and discuss the work of others. 


### Projects and submissions
There will be 4 graded projects during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills with room to express their own ideas.   
- Documentation and code should be uploaded by midnight the due date of the assignment. Feel free to adapt or change your project based on class feedback
- Projects should be brought to class ready for critique. 
- Participation in critique is part of overall class participation grade. 
- All code should be submitted via Github

## Expected skills 
Students are not expected to have any existing familiarity with programming beyond what we learned in CART253.  However, excitement and willingness to learn are a must! 
Students are further expected to be fully committed to engaging with programming as not just a technical but as a creative practice, constantly working to see ways in which the technical skills they are learning can be deployed in expressive and interesting ways and articulating those ideas both in code and speech/writing. 

## Moodle 
Moodle will be used to receive and submit assignments and grades. 

## GitHub 
Code examples and project outlines are available on Moodle as well as github. Studnets are expected to upload their work to Github

## Evaluation 
**Getting Back Into Code** (10%)  
The purpsoe of this short project is to get students back into code after the break. This project should be a small piece of code, experimetn, or iteration from a project last semester.  

**Project 1: Particles With Personalities** (20%)    
In this project every student will recieve a a specification to create a unique particle system using object oriented programming.

**Project 2: Data Visualizationn** (20%) In this project students will create a data visualization of any data set. 

**Project 3: Playful Interaction** (40%)   
This project is a playful interaction, that can be either a game, experience, or other interactive work. 

**Participation** (10%)   
Participation includes: attending class, completing coursework, asking questions, contributing to discussions, sharing ideas, and coming to office hours, emailing the instructor with updates on projects (even if you do not need help, make sure to touch base with the instructor regularly in some capacity). Maintaining an up to date github is part of participation for this class. 
Due: Assessed at the end of the course  

## French 
Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Given that this is a programming course, you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French. 

## Late work policy 
Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a B would lose two letter grades and receive a C+). Please get in touch with Lee before a deadline passes if you think you won’t make it.

## Academic integrity 
### Academic Ethics 
The most common offense under the Academic Code of Conduct is plagiarism, which the Code defines as “the presentation of the work of another person as one’s own or without proper acknowledgement.” This includes material copied word for word from books, journals, Internet sites, professor’s course notes, etc. It refers to material that is paraphrased but closely resembles the original source. It also includes for example the work of a fellow student, an answer on a quiz, data for a lab report, a paper or assignment completed by another student. It might be a paper purchased from any source. Plagiarism does not refer to words alone – it can refer to copying images, graphs, tables and ideas. “Presentation” is not limited to written work. It includes oral presentations, computer assignments and artistic works. Finally, if you translate the work of another person into any other language and do not cite the source, this is also plagiarism.   
In Simple Words: Do not copy, paraphrase or translate anything from anywhere without saying where you obtained it. (Source: Concordia’s Academic Integrity Website) 

## Academic ethics when programming 
When creating projects in code, make sure you attribute all elements that are not your own work, including images, sounds, and especially other people’s code (provide notes and links to the original work either in a README, at the top of your script, on in the same place as the usage). **Its okay to use and reference other people's code, you just have to make sure to credit it.**.

### Costs 
See the Department Syllabus 
All software students are expected to use in the class will be free. 

### Technology 
The practical work done in this class will take place on your own computer, with course software installed on it by you. The instructor is significantly more experienced with macOS, but will work to support Windows and even Linux as needed. This course does not require a significantly powerful machine beyond the ability to run a web browser.

## Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces 
The Department of Design and Computation Arts is committed to fostering an equitable and positive learning experience for all students, staff and faculty, free from discrimination based for example on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, religion, ethnicity, age, etc. We value diversity and difference, and strive together to create safer spaces in our classrooms, studios, and labs, where all students can fully engage in scholarly and artistic pursuits, knowing that harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, microaggressions, intolerance, disrespectful language, etc.) is unacceptable. We believe that celebrating difference is fundamental to supporting an academic community where innovation, creative exploration, and intellectual freedom can flourish. 

## Behaviour 
All individuals participating in courses are expected to be professional and constructive throughout the course, including in their communications. Concordia students are subject to the Code of Rights and Responsibilities which applies both when students are physically and virtually engaged in any University activity, including classes, seminars, meetings, etc. Students engaged in University activities must respect this Code when engaging with any members of the Concordia community, including faculty, staff, and students, whether such interactions are verbal or in writing, face to face or online/virtual. Failing to comply with the Code may result in charges and sanctions, as outlined in the Code.

It may not be distributed, published or broadcast, in whole or in part, without the express permission of the faculty member. Students are also forbidden to use their own means of recording any elements of an online class or lecture without express permission of the instructor. Any unauthorized sharing of course content may constitute a breach of the Academic Code of Conduct and/or the Code of Rights and Responsibilities.
